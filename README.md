# Java Fundamentals 🚀

Welcome to **Java Fundamentals**, a learning journey where we break down the core concepts of Java step by step.  
This repository complements my blog series on [Java Fundamentals](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/), where each concept is explained with simple examples, analogies, and beginner-friendly notes.

## 📚 What’s Inside
This repo is organized into **levels (folders)**, each covering a set of concepts:
- `Basics/` → The foundation of Java: introduction, first program, variables, operators, input & output.  
  Each folder contains:
  - **README.md** → Links to blog posts for that level.  
  - **Exercise Code** → A Java file combining all studied concepts into practice.  
  - **Project.md** → A small challenge/project to test your understanding.  

More levels will be added as the blog series grows (Control Flow, Loops, Arrays, OOP, etc.).

## 🎯 How to Use
1. Read the blog posts in order.  
2. Open the **exercise code** from the corresponding folder and try to:  
   - Break down the code  
   - Identify each concept we studied  
   - Run it and experiment by changing values  
3. Try solving the **project challenge** at the end of each level.

## 📌 Goal
This repo + blog combo is meant to give beginners a **clear, practical, and fun introduction to Java**.  
By the end, you’ll not only know the syntax but also **build small projects** along the way.
