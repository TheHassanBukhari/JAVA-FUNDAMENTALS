# Java Fundamentals

Welcome to **Java Fundamentals**, a learning journey where we break down the core concepts of Java step by step.  
This repository complements my blog series on [Java Fundamentals](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/), where each concept is explained with simple examples, analogies, and beginner-friendly notes.

---

## What’s Inside
This repo is organized into **levels (folders)**, each covering a set of concepts:
- `Basics/` → The foundation of Java: introduction, first program, variables, operators, input & output.  
  Each folder contains:
  - **README.md** → Links to blog posts for that level and details about excercise + project question.
  - **Exercise Code** → A Java file combining all studied concepts into practice.  

More levels will be added as the blog series grows (Control Flow, Loops, Arrays, OOP, etc.).

## Blog Series (Basics)
Here are the first 6 posts of the series:

1. [Introduction to Java](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/2025/08/01-java-fundamentals-introduction-to.html)  
2. [Your First Java Program (Hello World)](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/2025/08/02-java-fundamentals-your-first-java.html)  
3. [Variables and Data Types](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/2025/08/03-java-fundamentals-variables-and-data_25.html)  
4. [Operators in Java](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/2025/08/04-java-fundamentals-operators-in-java.html)  
5. [Input in Java](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/2025/08/05-java-fundamentals-input-in-java-by.html)  
6. [Output in Java](https://hassan-codes.blogspot.com/2025/08/06-java-fundamentals-output-in-java-by.html)

## How to Use
1. Read the blog posts in order.  
2. Open the **exercise code** from the corresponding folder and try to:  
   - Break down the code  
   - Identify each concept we studied  
   - Run it and experiment by changing values  
3. Try solving the **project challenge** at the end of each level.

## Goal
This repo + blog combo is meant to give beginners a **clear, practical, and fun introduction to Java**.  
By the end, you’ll not only know the syntax but also **build small projects** along the way.
